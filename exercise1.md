1. For Java language, the linting can be detect by using `SpotBugs`, which is free software uses static analysis to look up bugs in Java code.
The testing can be handle by using `JUnit` or `Selenium`.
The packaging can use the `Maven`, which is used for building and managing any Java-based project. The day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the `Maven`.

2. Alternative for Jenkins or Github actions is
 - Gitlab CI/CD
 - Azure Devops
 - CircleCI
 - Travis CI
 - CodeShip

3. The cloud-based solution would be better because of the cloud provider these days make things much more easier to set things up.
They also provide various type of configuration that we can decide which to use. With the self-hosted, scaling the application and its CI/CD
is not that easy, but with the cloud-based we can easily integrate it with other CI/CD tools or providers. Small and medium team size can easily
using the cloud-based solution and focusing on developing the application. They can get rid of monitoring themselves the health check of application, and let the cloud-based handle that. So the most important factor to make the decision will be based on the team,
and how complex the system is.
